# Tara Programming Language

**Tara is a strict, multi-paradigm programming language focused on explicit structure, predictable semantics, and deterministic execution.**  
Tara programs run on the **Tara Virtual Machine (TVM)**, a portable bytecode runtime designed for clarity, control, and extensibility.

Tara’s design philosophy emphasizes:

- Explicit behavior over implicit magic  
- Deterministic execution semantics  
- Strict type rules  
- Structured state and action composition  
- Diagnostic clarity as a first-class concern  

Tara is currently in active development.

# Project Status

Tara is in the early design and prototyping phase.  
Core language specifications, architecture decisions, and runtime models are actively being defined.

---

# Vision

Tara aims to explore alternative design choices in:

- Language strictness and predictability  
- Execution semantics  
- Runtime architecture  
- Resource and memory management strategies  
- Structured program composition
